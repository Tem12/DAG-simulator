# Really boring network:
# Ten miners, each with 10% hashing power, each
# connected to two neighbors in a ring.
description=Ten equal miners, connected in a ring

# miner syntax is:
# miner=hashrate type
# ... where type is what strategy for propagating
# new blocks they follow and optional_block_latency
# simulates the miner creating blocks that take
# that many seconds to relay/validate
